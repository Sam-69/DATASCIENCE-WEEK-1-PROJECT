Question 2). Let’s say you’re a Product Data Scientist at Instagram. How would you measure the success of the Instagram TV product?

In my role as a Product Data Scientist at Instagram, I'd have a bunch of ways to gauge how well IGTV is doing. Think of it as checking the pulse of this feature. We're talking about metrics, which are basically numbers that tell us what's going on. Here's what I'd look at:

(1)Views: This one's simple. It's about how many folks watched at least a bit of an IGTV video. We'd want to know if more people are tuning in over time.

(2)Average Watch Time: This is the average amount of time people spend watching IGTV videos. We'd want to see if folks are sticking around longer.

(3)Audience Retention: This tells us how many people watched an entire IGTV video from start to finish. Ideally, we'd like to see this number go up.

(4)Engagement Rate: We're talking about likes, comments, and shares here. It's important to know how often people are interacting with IGTV videos.

(5)Follower Growth: This is about how many new followers IGTV creators are getting. It's a good sign if this number keeps going up.

(Revenue: Money talks, right? We'd keep tabs on how much cash Instagram is making from IGTV ads.

Now, beyond these core metrics, there are some other things I'd keep an eye on:

(1)Top IGTV Creators: Who's getting the most views, followers, and engagement? That can tell us what kind of content is really hitting the mark.

(2)Popular IGTV Categories: What types of IGTV videos are people loving the most? We'd want to know what categories are trending.

(3)IGTV Discovery Features: How effective are the features that help folks find IGTV content? We'd study stuff like the Explore feed and recommendations.

(4)IGTV User Satisfaction: Are people happy with IGTV? This matters a lot, and we'd want to know if folks are enjoying the product.

So, what's the point of all this data tracking? Well, it helps us figure out what's working and what's not with IGTV. For instance:

(1)If we see views going up, we know people are tuning in more.
(2)If the average watch time is increasing, it means people are finding content they like.
(3)If engagement rates are high, it means users are getting involved.

Ultimately, by keeping an eye on these metrics, we can make IGTV better and more enjoyable for everyone. It's all about understanding what makes IGTV tick and improving it as we go along.
